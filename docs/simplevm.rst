Setting up your de.NBI Cloud SimpleVM instance
==============================================

As metagenome assemblies require a lot of compute resources, we will run the tutorial
in the `de.NBI Cloud <http://cloud.denbi.de>`. Each workshop participant has access to
a virtual machine and run all jobs on it. 
All necessary software tools have been pre-installed on this VM.

Use the link you received via e-Mail to connect to your instance and open a terminal.
